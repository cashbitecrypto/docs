# Introduction

Welcome to the CashBite documentation!

## What is CashBite?

CashBite is a cryptocurrency forked (or copied) from [TurtleCoin](https://turtlecoin.lol).

## Terminology

- A **blockchain** is a digital record which keeps track of transactions. It is made of sequential blocks which build on each other, this makes it permanent and impossible to change.
- A **block** is a group of data which is stored in the blockchain. Each block is made up of transactions between users.
- A **wallet** is like an 'account' on the blockchain and lets you send and receive currency. The wallet is a set of public encryption keys (i.e. public and private). The public key is shared and allows you to receive currency and the private key is for creating transactions. If the keys are lost, anything stored in the wallet is unrecoverable.
- A **paper wallet** is a wallet which as the name suggests, has it's keys printed on physical paper. This means that you have a physical backup of your keys. They can also be used to physically give cryptocurrency to someone else. They can be used as a 'break glass' type of way as well, where you have the private key hidden until you would like to withdraw currency.
- **Mining** is the process of validating transactions between accounts. People who mine are rewarded with a small amount of currency.
- A **node** is a computer which stores a copy of the blockchain. Lots of nodes are required so that the cryptocurrency is decentralized.
